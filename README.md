#Predicting Stock Market Trends from News Headlines

## Project Description
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict stock market trends based on news headlines.
By analysing the sentiment of news, I aim to forecast market movements, providing insights for investors and traders.
I chose Python for its robust libraries like Pandas and Scikit-Learn, which seemed optimal for this project.
During development, I faced challenges: Dealing with unstructured text data and ensuring accurate sentiment analysis.
